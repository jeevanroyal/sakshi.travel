  <h3>Itinerary</h3>
  <p><b>Day 1: Arrive in Athens</b></p>

Welcome to Greece. Arrive at airport and transfer to hotel for your stay. You have rest of day at leisure. Overnight stay in Athens.
<p><b>Day 2: Athens - Half Day city tour with Acropolis and Museum</b></p>

In the morning you will be picked up from your hotel and start the half-day tour to Athens. This tour gives you an opportunity to observe the striking contrasts that make Athens such a fascinating city. Our expert guides will take you to see the Panathenaic Stadium where the first Olympic Games of modern times were held in 1896 (short stop). Continue and pass by the Presidential residence (ex Royal Palace) guarded by the Euzones in their colorful uniform, the Temple of Olympian Zeus, the Hadrian’s Arch, the Parliament and the memorial to the Unknown Soldier, the Academy, the University, the National Library, the Constitution Square (Syntagma). On the Acropolis visit the Architectural Masterpieces of the Golden Age of Athens: The Propylaea, the Temple of Athena Nike, the Erechtheion and finally “the harmony between material and spirit”, the monument that “puts order in the mind”, the Parthenon. Continue and visit the place where at last the statues found their home and admire the wonders of the classical era: The new Acropolis museum. Return to the hotel for a free afternoon. Overnight stay in Athens.
<p><b>Day 3: Athens - Mykonos</b></p>

After breakfast Transfer to Piraeus port for your ferry embarkation to Mykonos Island. Mykonos sits amidst the Aegean Sea like a unique jewell handcrafted by time, the Greek sun and an anonymous local craftsman. All that can be said or written about Mykonos would be just too little. For centuries Mykonos existed under the shade of the religious centre of Delos and it had to wait until the 20th century to reach its international status and win a place on the world tourist map. Mykonos,  famously called 'the island of the winds' due to the constant wind that blows, is the most popular and cosmopolitan island of the Cyclades and considered as one the most famous islands of the world. The sunlight of Mykonos from its first sunshine of dawn all the way to its last of the sunset is astonishing and supplements an atmosphere of images that seem to have sprung out of a painting. Arrival in Mykonos and transfer to your hotel. Rest of the day is free in order to explore the island. Overnight stay in Mykonos.





<p><b>Day 4: Mykonos</b></p>

Free day at leisure for shopping or individual activities. Overnight stay in Mykonos.

<p><b>Day 5: Mykonos - Santorini</b></p>

After breakfast check out from hotel & transfer to the port of Mykonos for your ferry trip to Santorini Island. (High-speed boat) A thousand sunsets, a thousand memories, a thousand heartbeats, colors of blue red & gold streaking the sky ... this is Santorini island ... Poets have written about it, artists attempt to capture its beauty. Nothing can quite describe ... the unsurpassed magic of Santorini. This tiny Greek island in the Aegean sea, rich in history & steeped in myth, is situated on the southern east tip of the Cyclades Cluster. Once famous for its seafaring captains & thriving trade from Russia towards England, France & Italy, & even further back in time the biblical volcanic catastrophe of 1500 BC, today Santorini is one of the most popular holiday destinations worldwide. Arrival in Santorini and transfer to your hotel. Rest of the day is yours to spend in order to explore the island and admire the breathtaking view. Overnight stay in Santorini.
<p><b>Day 6: Santorini - Half day volcano & hot springs tour</b></p>

This morning proceed to enjoy volcano & hot springs tour. The tour departs daily from the old port of Fira. After only 10 minutes by boat, we'll be arriving at the harbor of Erinia which is the name of the small volcano bay, where we'll be docking for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, during which, if you want, you can follow the path to the top where active craters are. Next we'll be moving to the island of Palea Kameni for the hot springs, the famous mud baths, which were formed as result of volcanic eruptions. In the small bay of Agios Nikolaos the water temperature ranges from 30 to 35 degrees Celsius, as it mixes continuously with the normal sea currents. The boat will be staying here about 30 minutes to allow you a healthy bath. After the bath, you will return to the old port of Fira. Overnight stay in Santorini.
<p><b>Day 7: Santorini - Departure</b></p>

After breakfast you will be transferred to the Airport for your flight to Athens and then back home – or extend your stay in Greece. Be sure to leave full of wonderful memories, having found a new and comfortable home in Greece.
